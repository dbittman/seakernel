		default=y
		desc=Enables multi-processor support
	}
	key=CONFIG_MAX_CPUS {
		name=Maximum Number of CPUs
		depends=CONFIG_SMP
		default=64
		desc=The maximum number of CPUs the kernel will support. If the
			 machine has more CPUs, they will not be initialized.
	}
}
process {
	key=CONFIG_MAX_TASKS {
		name=Maximum allowed simultaneous processes
		default=-1
		desc=The maximum allowed number of processes to run at the same time.
			 A value of negative 1 will disable a limit
	}

		name=Number of pages for user-space stack
		default=20
		desc=The number of pages used by a user-space process for the stack.
	}
	key=CONFIG_OOM_HANDLER {
		name=Action to take when out of physical memory
		ans=1,2
		default=1
		desc=When the physical memory manager runs out of ram, it will either:
			 1) Kill the process, or 2) Suspend the process.
			 These are the selections. Suspending the process can lead to
			 lock ups.
	}
	key=CONFIG_BLOCK_CACHE {
		name=Enable system-wide caching of block devices
		ans=y,n
		default=y
		desc=Enables the kernel to keep recently accessed blocks in memory
			 for faster access later.
	}
	key=CONFIG_BLOCK_READ_CACHE {
		name=Enable read-caching of block devices
		ans=y,n
		depends=CONFIG_BLOCK_CACHE
		default=y
		desc=Enables blocks that were read to be stored immediately for
			 faster access later. If this is disabled, only writes will be cached.
	}
	key=CONFIG_SCHED_TTY {
		name=Prioritize tasks on current tty
		ans=y,n
		default=y
		desc=Runs the processes that are bound to the current tty more often,
			 hopefully giving a boost to responsiveness.
	}
	key=CONFIG_SCHED_TTY_AMOUNT {
		name=Amount of prioritization for tasks on current tty
		default=550
		depends=CONFIG_SCHED_TTY
		desc=This number is the number of times a task will be gauranteed
		to run before relinquishing its timeslice (EXPERIMENTAL)
	}
	
}
memory {
	key=CONFIG_CONTIGUOUS_MEMORY {
		name=Amount of contiguous ram to keep contiguous
		default=64
		ans=1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128
		desc=Allocates a certain amount of contiguous ram
		to serve to modules and kernel functions that need
		contiguous amounts of ram in sizes larger than a page, for
		example DMA operations.
	}
}
key=CONFIG_LOG_LEVEL {
	name=Console logging level
	ans=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
	default=4
	desc=The lowest message level which will get printed to the screen.
		 Lower levels are for debugging, higher levels are for errors.
}
key=CONFIG_GDB_STUB {
	name=Compile in the GDB kernel stub
	asn=y,n
	default=n
	desc=Compile the kernel GDB stub. This will allow you to connect GDB remotely
	and debug the kernel. This is only supported in x86.
}
key=CONFIG_MODULE_PATH {
	name=System module directory
	default=/sys/modules/
	desc=The location where modules will be stored in the filesystem.
} 
key=CONFIG_DEBUG {
	name=Kernel debugging features
	default=y
	ans=y,n
	desc=Enables various kernel features for debugging purposes. 
}
key=CONFIG_SERIAL_DEBUG {
	name=Serial port debug messages
	default=y
	ans=y,n
	desc=Print out log-level 0 messages to the serial port (can be slow on real hardware)
}
key=CONFIG_MODULES {
	name=Enable loadable module support
	ans=y,n
	default=y
	dnwv=n
	desc=Enables code to load and execute modules, as well as export kernel symbols.
		 This is required for most drivers.
}
key=CONFIG_SWAP {
	name=Enable swapping physical memory to disk
	ans=y,n
	default=n
	desc=This allows the kernel to free up physical memory by writing less-used pages
	to the hard drive. When needed, these pages will be brought back into ram on demand.
}
key=CONFIG_ENABLE_ASSERTS {
	name=Enable asserts in kernel code (for debugging)
	ans=y,n
	default=y
	desc=Asserts are included in kernel code to check runtime logic of kernel algorithms.
	This option allows them to be disabled (preventing a number of function calls and if
	statements useful for debugging only).
